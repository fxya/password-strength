# Password Strength API

Building a WebSocket API endpoint to check password strength. Built with Spring + Vue. Not to be used for anything actually depending on a secure algorithm for password strength!

## Running

Start the development server and navigate to localhost:8080/password/strength. Note that the current dev build is using CDN distributed versions of Vue and Babel for in-browser transpilation so you don't need to explicitly install these dependencies (may change).
